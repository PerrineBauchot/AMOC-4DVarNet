# AMOC_4DVarNet
Codes of variational assimilation methods used to reconstruct the considered AMOC ideal system

1. AMOC_4DVar_classic.py:
   - simulates the AMOC system and generates observations
   - performs a 4DVar data assimilation
     
2. AMOC_4DVarNet.py:
   - loads the data into training and test datasets
   - implements the possible different sampling strategies
   - performs a 4DVarNet data assimilation with the neural model being encoded with and without the physical model
